This assignment is based off a dataset from reddit /r/pcmasterrace. A study of rigs on there from the early half of 2015.The data on PCMR was given to me by /U/ Das5heep on reddit.

There are about 5 disntictive graphs.
-> Stem and leaf
-> RAM
-> Half Circle
-> Resolution

Finally there is a section for general statistics for data that I didn't fully get to implement.
The main objective was to contrast different companies and how the conusmer goes about buying the main companies products.
We can see evident contrasts between AMD vs NVIDIA and AMD vs Intel. 
From this all it's obvious that AMD lag behind in everything....Sad news for the consumer in the end....

For this reason you can see differences in the data (stem and leaf at that point in time the FURY X GPU wasn't out affecting the 500/700+Gpu price range).
